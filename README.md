CRCM6/GEM5.0 README

This README file briefly describes the CRCM6/GEM5.0 code.


1) OVERVIEW OF THE CODE

The CRCM6/GEM5.0 code is based on multiple model codes, including:

1.1) Version 5.0 of the Global Environmental Multiscale (GEM) model developed by the Atmospheric Numerical Prediction Research Section, Meteorological Research Division, of Environment and Climate Change Canada (ECCC). References describing various aspects of the model include: Côté et al. (1998), Girard et al. (2014) and McTaggart-Cowan et al. (2019). McTaggart-Cowan et al. (2019) provides a comprehensive description of the model.

1.2) Version 3.6.2 of the Canadian Land Surface Scheme developed predominantly within ECCC with the exception of an organized community effort as part of the Canadian Climate Research Network (1994 – 1997; Verseghy, 2000) as well as ad-hoc collaborations with the broader research community. References describing various aspects of the model include: Verseghy (1991), Verseghy et al. (1993), Verseghy (2000) and Verseghy (2017).

1.3) The FLake model. References describing some aspects of the model and its implementation into the CRCM model include Mironov (2010) and Martynov et al. (2012).


2) OVERVIEW OF LICENCES

The CRCM6/GEM5.0 code is distributed under the following licenses:
2.1) The GEM dynamics software is licensed under the LGPL version 2.1. This license permits UQAM to use, copy, modify and distribute the GEM dynamics software subject to compliance with the LGPL version 2.1 license.
2.2) The GEM physics software is licensed under the Environment Canada - Atmospheric Science and Technology License/Disclaimer, version 3 (May 7, 2008). This license permits UQAM to use, copy, modify, improve and distribute the GEM physics software, and any derivative works thereof (including software outputs), and its supporting documentation for any purpose whatsoever, except for commercial sales.
2.3) The CLASS model is now distributed as part of the Canadian Land Surface Scheme Including Biogeochemical Cycles (CLASSIC). CLASSIC is distributed under the Open Government License - Canada (http://data.gc.ca/eng/open-government-licence-canada) and the GNU General Public License version 2. Also note that some portions of xml-fortran (http://xml-fortran.sourceforge.net) have been used in the CLASSIC code. 
2.4) The Flake model is freely available under the terms of the MIT license.
