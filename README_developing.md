Layout
======

This section describes the basic layout of the repository, where things are,
what files and directories are expected and what is their role.

This MIG repository is referred to as the *super-repo*  (a *mono-repos*
including all MIG products, all sub-repositories; called components).

The main MIG directory has the following files and directories:

  * `.gitignore `: List of path patterns (one per line) ignored by `git`
  * `.setenv.dot`: script called in the
    [Initial Setup](README_building.md#initial-setup) process to establish
    the Shell environment
  * `DEPENDENCIES`: list the name and origin of each components
  * `Makefile.user.mk`: MIG main targets for `gmake` (used in the *build-dir*)
  * `Makefile.user.root.mk`: MIG main targets for `gmake` (used in the *root-dir*)
  * `README*.md`: MIG's instructions files
  * `VERSION   `: MIG's version number
  * `_bin/     `: MIG's helper scripts
  * `_share/   `: MIG's misc. data files for the helper scripts
  * `_migdep/  `: dummy MIG component used to define common external
    dependencies to be loaded.
  * All other subdirectories are MIG's components, as described by
    the `DEPENDENCIES` file

Each component is in its own sub-directory and is imported using the
`git subtree` command. They are considered independent repositories and
thus can be maintained and built independently. These
components/sub-directories need to contain the following mandatory
sub-directories and files:

  * `*/.name      `: Component's name, equivalent to the sub dir they are
    imported in. This file is used by some `rde` scripts.
  * `*/.setenv.dot`: script called in the
    [Initial Setup](README_building.md#initial-setup) process to establish
    the Shell environment
  * `*/DESCRIPTION`: Component's description
  * `*/VERSION    `: Component's version number
  * `*/.ssm.d/    `: SSM mandatory files
  * `*/include/   `: used for included files and sub-Makefiles.  
    Will be added to the `INCLUDE_PATH`
  * `*/include/Makefile.local.NAME.mk`: Component's targets for `gmake`
  * `*/include/Makefile.ssm.mk`: Component's targets for `gmake` used in the
    install process

Additionally these components/sub-directories may contain the following
optional sub-directories and files:

  * `*/DEPENDENCIES.mig.bndl`: Component's list of dependencies on other MIG components
  * `*/DEPENDENCIES.external.*.bndl`: Component's list of *external* (non MIG)
    dependencies, in addition to the ones listed in `_migdep/`
  * `*/bin/       `: Component's specific scripts. Could be Shell, python or
    else. For python modules or similar, it is best to put them under the
    `lib/python/` dir.  
    Will be added to the `PATH`
  * `*/bin/.env_setup.dot`: used to define some Shell env. var.
    It may be called in the [Initial Setup](README_building.md#initial-setup)
    process and, post-installation, in the SSM load process.
  * `*/lib/       `: Python, R, and other libraries or modules should be
    placed under the `lib/` dir.  
    For python modules or similar, it is best to put them under the
    `lib/python/` dir.  
    Will be added to the `LIBRARY_PATH`
  * `*/lib/python/`: used for python modules.  
    Will be added to the `PYTHONPATH`
  * `*/src/       `: Directory and sub-directories for Fortran or C source files.
    The dependency analyzer will create a list of objects files separated for
    each `src/` sub-directories and these can thus be considered as
    individual libraries.  
    Will be added to the `gmake` source path (`VPATH`).
  * `*/share/     `: Most of the other things exported by a component that
    is not source code, lib or scripts should be put under the `share/` dir.
  * `*/.restricted`: Directories including this file will not be added to
    the `gmake` source path (`VPATH`) unless `${ORDENV_PLAT}` match one of the
    lines in this file (whitelist).


Detailed description
--------------------

### .setenv.dot ###

`.setenv.dot` script (bash Shell script) is *sourced* in the
[Initial Setup](README_building.md#initial-setup) process to establish the
Shell environment. It must:

  * support `--external` argument to load only *external* dependencies (outside MIG)
  * load needed *dependencies*
  * set PATH, LIBPATH, PYTHONPATH
  * set other needed Shell environment vars.


### VERSION ###

It defines the component's present version number.

To keep track of what is what and from where it comes from, a naming
convention for version numbers is useful. This convention is described
in [README\_version\_convention.md](README_version_convention.md).


### DEPENDENCIES ###

List the name and origin of each components, its URL and tag.

  * each line in `DEPENDENCIES` has the format (lowercase): `name=url/tag`
  * tags have the format `name_version` in lowercase

> *Note*: Components' version in this file can be automatically updated
> (after the [Initial Setup](README_building.md#initial-setup) process) with
> a helper script:  
> `_bin/migdepupdater.ksh -v --gitdep --check`

> See also [README\_version\_convention.md](README_version_convention.md) for
> details on components path (`d/`, `x/`, `tests/`).


### DEPENDENCIES.mig.bndl ###

Component's list of dependencies on other MIG components.

This file has the *bundle* format recognized by the `r.load.dot` RPN utility.

  * one component per line
  * relative or absolute path to the installed component's specific version

> *Note*: Components' version in these files can be automatically updated
> (after the [Initial Setup](README_building.md#initial-setup) process) with
> a helper script:  
> `_bin/migdepupdater.ksh -v --gitdep --check`

> See: [r.load.dot CMC wiki page](https://wiki.cmc.ec.gc.ca/wiki/R.load.dot)
> for details on RPN's `r.load.dot` *bundle* format.


### DEPENDENCIES.external.*.bndl ###

Component's list of external dependencies in addition to the ones listed
in `_migdep/`.

This file has the *bundle* format recognized by the `r.load.dot` RPN utility.

  * one component per line
  * relative or absolute path to the installed component's specific version

> *Note 1*: The file name must match `DEPENDENCIES.external.${RDENETWORK}.bndl`,
> where `${RDENETWORK}` should have been defined in the
> [Initial Setup](README_building.md#initial-setup) process.  
> Known `${RDENETWORK}` values: "cmc" or "science".

> *Note 2*: *external* dependencies must be defined and updated for *every*
> known `${RDENETWORK}`: "cmc" and "science".


### _migdep ###

Dummy MIG component used to define common *external* dependencies to be loaded.

These *external* dependencies are listed in the `DEPENDENCIES.external.*.bndl`
files. See above for the file format details.


### include/ ###

Fortran or C source files to be included.
Place here the files that can be included from other components.
Preferably put file that should not be included from other components in
the `src/` dir. Components' specific Makefiles variables, rules and targets
should be specified in the `include/Makefile.local*mk` file.


### include/Makefile.local.NAME.mk ###

Component's targets for `gmake` used in the compile and build process

> *Note*: all these components' Makefiles will be merged/included into
> the main one, please make sure modifications to them does not have
> undesired side effect on other components.  
> It is a good idea to use unique prefix on vars and targets.

*Expected vars and targets*

  * `NAME_VERSION`: Version number, normally read from the
    components's `VERSION` file for consistency
  * `NAME_VFILES` : list of targets for *version files* creation
  * `NAME_LIBS_ALL_FILES_PLUS`: list of targets for *libs* creation
  * `NAME_ABS`: list of targets for *abs* creation
  * `NAME_ABS_FILES`: list of *abs-file names* to be created, full path

> `NAME` in the above *var names* is to be replaced by the component's name
> (upper case) as found in the `*/.name` files.

The `Makefile.dep.${ARCH}.mk` file, generated by `make dep`, provides other
interesting vars and targets you may want to use in `Makefile.local.*.mk`.
It also contains auto-built source dependencies for Fortran and C source
code and exports a number of symbols that may be used in the component's
`Makefile.local.*.mk` file.
Among the most interesting ones:

  * `TOPDIRLIST_name`: list of top directories, corresponds to the list of
    component's full paths
  * `SUBDIRLIST_name`: list of component's source sub directories
  * `OBJECTS`: list of objects to be created, for all components
  * `OBJECTS_name`: list of component's  objects to be created
  * `OBJECTS_name_subname`: list of component's objects to be created
     from a specific sub directory
  * `FORTRAN_MODULES`: list of Fortran modules to be created, for all components
  * `FORTRAN_MODULES_name`: list of component's Fortran modules to be created

> `name` and `NAME` in the above var names is to be replaced by the component's name
> (lower and upper case respectively)

Finally, RDE's `Makefiles.*.mk` exports many other symbols and targets used
in the build process.

> **TODO**: other details about RDE, ouv_exp_gem/srcpath, linkit/builddir/.rde.config.dot, rules/targets, .rde.setenv.dot, ...


### include/Makefile.ssm.mk ###

Component's targets for `gmake` used in the install process.

> *Note*: all these components' Makefiles will be merged/included into the
> main one, please make sure modifications to them does not have undesired
> side effect on other components.  
> It is a good idea to use unique prefix on vars and targets.

*Expected vars and targets*

  * `NAME_SSMALL_FILES`: list of targets for creation of ssm package, type all
  * `NAME_SSMARCH_FILES`: list of targets for creation of ssm package, arch specific
  * `NAME_INSTALL`: list of install targets
  * `NAME_UNINSTALL`: list of uninstall targets

> `NAME` in the above var names is to be replaced by the component's name
> (upper case)


### .restricted ###

This file is used by the automatic dependencies generator called by `make dep`.
It is a text file with white-list of arch (one per line) on which the
dependency analyzer can operate.

  * No `.restricted` file means the dir will be analysed for dependencies.
  * A directory with an empty `.restricted` will be ignored by the
    dependencies analyzer *on all arch*.
  * A directory with a not empty `.restricted` will be ignored by the
    dependencies analyzer *on arch NOT matching one the white-list
    arch (`${ORDENV_PLAT}`)*.

The `.restricted` file may be used in the `*/include/` and `*/scr/` sub
directories.


Making Modifications
====================

Changes should be made incrementally one "feature" at a time.  
All modifications should be tested before being committed and shared.

The process should

  1. Modify: make your own modifications or integrate others' changes.  
     See details on some [specific cases](#modifications-specific-cases) below.
  2. Compile and Build: See the [Compile and Build](#compile-and-build) section
     below for details.
  3. Test: Tests should be run *before* committing or sharing your modifications.  
     See the [test](#test) section below for details.
  4. Commit: save your changes incrementally one "feature"
     at a time with a description of the changes.  
     See details in the [commit and tags section](#commit-and-tags) below.
  5. Tag: tags can be added to more precisely identify a set of commits,
     a version, a milestone, for future reference or a temporary point to
     return back to.  
     See details in the [commit and tags section](#commit-and-tags) below.
  6. Share your modifications.  
     See details in the [contribute back section](#contribute-back-share) below.

> *Note 1*: It would be ideal before doing any modifications to create an
> issue in the [CMC Bugzilla](http://bugzilla.cmc.ec.gc.ca) issue tracker.
> This will define intent and the scope of the changes. This info can be
> added the commit message afterward.

> *Note 2*: Details regarding updating components' version number and other
> support files are addressed in [README\_installing.md](README_installing.md).

> *Note 3*: details on using `git` and its powerful features (merge, rebase,
> pull, push, ...) allowing parallel development with branches and other clones
> may be learnt from the abundant online documentation.


Compile and Build
-----------------

Whenever the source code is modified, the compiling options are changed or the dependencies updated, you need to re-compile and build the libraries and
executable.

*Quick start*

    make buildclean  ## Optional, needed for compiler options or dependencies changes,
                     ## or when source code files where removed
    make deplocal
    make vfiles
    make libs -j ${MAKE_NPE:-6}
    make abs  # -j ${MAKE_NPE:-6}

For detailed instructions, please follow:

  * [Initial Setup](README_building.md#initial-setup) instructions in [README\_building.md](README_building.md) to perform the initial Shell environment and working directory setup.
  * [Compiling and Building](README_building.md#2.-compilingband-building) instructions in [README\_building.md](README_building.md).

> *Note 1*: If you're planning on running in batch mode, submitting to another
> machine, make sure you do the *initial setup* and compilation,
> on the machine where the job will be submitted.

> *Note 2*: The compiler is specified as an external dependency in
> the "`_migdep/DEPENDENCIES.external.*.bndl`" files.  
> Compiler options, rules and targets are specified in each component's
> Makefiles (`*/include/Makefile.local*mk` files).  
> For details, see:
> * [Dependencies Update](#dependencies-update)
> * [Compiler Options Update](#compiler-options-update)


Test
----

Tests should be run to make sure the modifications have the intended effect
as well as for making sure there are no negative side effects in
other configurations.

> Tests should be performed *before* committing or sharing your modifications.

**TODO**: some details

> See running instructions in [README\_running.md](README_running.md)
> for more details.


Commit and Tags
---------------

Commit is *git* way of *saving* your changes. Changes should be saved
incrementally, one "feature" at a time, with a description of the changes.

*Before* issuing the commit command
  * Test the changes!
  * Inspect changes to be committed, use `modelutils/bin/r.gitdiff -d --cached`
  * Make sure the needed files have been added, removed or renamed.  
    Sample commands:
````bash
    git status
    git add FILENAME    ## Add new files or add modification for next commit
    git rm FILENAME
    git mv OLDNAME NEWNAME
````
  * Make sure you are not committing un-related changes.  
    Use `git reset -- PATH/TO/FILE` to move back files to
    *not staged for commit* status (like a `git add` inverse operation).

> It is best to *avoid committing*:
> * with option to auto add modified files (`-a`); this is to avoid committing
>   unrelated changes
> * binary files
> * very large files
> * relative links pointing outside the repository tree or absolute links.

If you are not the author of the code, you may specify the author like this:

    git commit --author='First Last <first.last@canada.ca>'

> See also *commit best practice* on the
> [who-t blog](http://who-t.blogspot.com/2009/12/on-commit-messages.html).


**Commit message best practices**

> Don't describe the code, describe the intent and the approach.  
> And keep the log in a present tense.

The git commit log is 3 parts:

  1. a short (50-78) summary on the first line
  2. a blank line
  3. a longer description that should explain:
    * why is this necessary?
    * how does it address the issue?
    * what effect does this patch has?

> See also *commit log best practice* on the
> [who-t blog](http://who-t.blogspot.com/2009/12/on-commit-messages.html) or
> on the  [CMC wiki](https://wiki.cmc.ec.gc.ca/wiki/Svn/Commit_howto).


**Tagging**

If you reached a milestone (like a version) with your code or
if you'd like to easily come back to that specific version later,
it may be useful to mark that specific version with a meaningful tag.
This is simply done with:

    git tag TAGNAME

> See tag naming convention in
> [README\_version\_convention.md](README_version_convention.md).


Modifications: Specific Cases
-----------------------------

### Shell Env. SetUp Update ###

> **Quick Ref.**
>
> Files to edit: `*/bin/.env_setup.dot`  
> Mostly defines Shell environment vars.

> You'll need to re-do the [Initial Setup](README_building.md#initial-setup)
> process after modifying this.

The Shell environment can be set in 2 different ways:
  * when working with the full code, it is set by the `*/.setenv.dot` scripts
  * once installed, it is set by the `r.load.dot` RPN-SI script,

To minimize duplications, `*/.setenv.dot` scripts should replicate as much as
possible the `r.load.dot` functionalities. Common stuff should be moved to
other scripts that would be *sourced* by both.

  * dependencies, including compilers, are found in the
    `*/DEPENDENCIES*.bndl` files.  
    See [Dependencies Update section](#dependencies-update) for details.
  * the `*/bin/.env_setup.dot` files (bash scripts) are sourced by both.
    They define other Shell env. vars.

> See: [r.load.dot CMC wiki page](https://wiki.cmc.ec.gc.ca/wiki/R.load.dot)
> for details on RPN's `r.load.dot` utility.


### Dependencies Update ###

> **Quick Ref.**
>
> Files to edit (RPN's `r.load.dot` *bundle* format):
> * External dependencies: `*/DEPENDENCIES.external.*.bndl`
>   * common to all components: `_migdep/DEPENDENCIES.external.*.bndl`
> * Cross-MIG dependencies: `*/DEPENDENCIES.mig.bndl`
>   * May refer to common externals: `ENV/x/migdep/VERSION`
>   * Use the following script to make version numbers consistent:  
>     `_bin/migdepupdater.ksh -v --gitdep --check`

> You'll need to re-do the [Initial Setup](README_building.md#initial-setup)
> process after modifying this.

MIG has several types of dependency files:

  * **MIG's dependencies**:
    These files are mainly for housekeeping by the librarian.  
    *You do not have to edit them.*
    * Present version Git dependencies: "`DEPENDENCIES`" file  
      This file is used by the "`_bin/migsplitsubtree.ksh`" script.  
      This file format is one line per component:  
      `NAME=URL/TAG`
    * All MIG versions Git dependencies: "`_share/migversions.txt`" file  
      This file is used by the "`_bin/migimportall.ksh`" script.  
      This file format is one line per version:  
      `branch=MIGBRANCH; tag=MIGTAG ; components="COMP1NAME/COMP1TAG COMP2NAME/COMP2TAG ..."`
  * **Components' dependencies**  
    *These files are the ones you should be editing.*
    * local, cross-MIG, dependencies; components depend on each other.  
      `*/DEPENDENCIES.mig.bndl`
    * external dependencies, those that are not part of the MIG super repos.  
      `*/DEPENDENCIES.external.*.bndl`

You may update the dependencies list or versions by editing the components'
dependencies files `*/DEPENDENCIES.*.bndl`.
Theses files have the RPN's "`r.load.dot`" *bundle* format.

Notes:

- *external* dependencies must be defined and updated, kept in sync,
  for *every* known `${RDENETWORK}`: "cmc" and "science".

- *external* dependencies common to most components must be defined in
  the `_migdep/DEPENDENCIES.external.*.bndl` files.

- For local, cross-MIG, dependencies' version, please use the following
  script to make them consistent instead of updating them by hand:  
  `_bin/migdepupdater.ksh -v --gitdep --check`


> See: [r.load.dot CMC wiki page](https://wiki.cmc.ec.gc.ca/wiki/R.load.dot)
> for details on RPN's `r.load.dot` *bundle* format.

> See: [README\_version\_convention.md](README_version_convention.md) for
> details on naming convention used in the `*/DEPENDENCIES.mig.bndl` files.


### Compiler Options Update ###

> **Quick Ref.**
>
> Files to edit:
>   * `*/include/Makefile.*.mk`
>   * `Makefile.user*.mk`
>   * Source files (overrides)
>
> `COMP_RULES_FILE = /PATH/TO/YOUR_COMP_RULES_FILES` can also be added to any
> `Makefile` to override default compiler options.

> You'll need to clean (`buildclean`) and re-do the 
> [compile/build process](README_building.md) after modifying this.

The compile/build system is based on `gmake` and on 2 wrappers on top
of the compiler:

  * RPN/CMC *Compiler Rules* used with their own "`s.compile`" script.  
    You can visualize these with (after the
    [Initial Setup](README_building.md#initial-setup)):  

        cat $(s.get_compiler_rules)

    *Note that the "`s.get_compiler_rules`" script comes from SSC and
    is not part of the MIG super repos.*  
    *This wrappers is needed for compiler options consistency with other
    libraries and product from EC/CMC*

  * RDE Makefiles and scripts, see the *rde* component for details.  
    Edit the following files to update the compiler rules.
    * RDE defines basic Makefile vars, rules and targets.  
      File: `rde/include/Makefile*`
    * every components can add specific Makefile vars, rules and targets.  
      File: `*/include/Makefile.local*.mk`
    * MIG can have specific Makefile vars, rules and targets.  
      *Note that this file is not used in the installed GEM.*  
      File: `Makefile.user*.mk`

On top of this, *RDE* supports per file compiler options overrides. You can add
or suppress options for a specific compiler in any source file by adding a *RDE
directive* at the top of the source file. The directive takes the forms:
   * Fortran: `!COMP_ARCH=compilername ; -add=options -suppress=options`
   * C: `/*COMP_ARCH=compilername ; -add=options -suppress=options*/`

For example:

    !COMP_ARCH=intel-2016.1.156 ; -add=-C -g -traceback -ftrapuv

> See [RDE documentation on the CMC wiki](https://wiki.cmc.ec.gc.ca/wiki/Rde)
> for details. (**TODO**: include RDE doc as a README.md in the git repos)

Finally, if the main RPN/CMC *Compiler Rules* (`s.get_compiler_rules`) is not
suiting your needs, you can override it with you own. To do so, in any of
the Makefiles, set:

    COMP_RULES_FILE = /PATH/TO/YOUR_COMP_RULES_FILES

> Description of the compiler rules files is beyond the scope of this doc.  
> You may want to start from the original one and modify it:  
> `cp $(s.get_compiler_rules) MY_COMP_RULES_FILE`

Thus compiler options, rules and targets can be modified in:

  * `*/include/Makefile*`: add `COMP_RULES_FILE=` to override system-wide
    default options
  * `rde/include/Makefile*`: for system-wide options
  * `*/include/Makefile*`: for components specific options
  * `*/src/*`: for file specific options
  * `Makefile.user*.mk`: for full MIG build system specific options

> See [include/Makefile.local.NAME.mk](#includemakefilelocalnamemk) above for
> expected components' Makefile targets and vars.


### Remove a Component ###

> Before this step, it is best to commit any other changes you may have.

Removing a component is as simple as removing its directory, its reference in MIG's DEPENDENCY list and other components' dependency to it.

    compname=MYNAME                      ## Set to appropriate name
    rm -rf ${compname}
    cat DEPENDENCIES | egrep -v "^${compname}="  1>  ${compname}.dep.$$
    mv ${compname}.dep.$$ DEPENDENCIES
    for item in $(ls -1 */DEPENDENCIES.mig.bndl) ; do
        cat ${item} | grep -v "/${compname}/"  1>  ${compname}.dep.$$
        mv ${compname}.dep.$$ ${item}
    done


> You'll need to re-do the [Initial Setup](README_building.md#initial-setup)
> process after modifying this.


### Add a Component ###

> Before this step, it is best to commit any other changes you may have.

To add a component, use `git subtree add` to import its repository in MIG
and add its reference in MIG's DEPENDENCY list:

    compname=MYNAME                      ## Set to appropriate name
    compversion=MYVERSION                ## Set to appropriate version
    comptag=${compname}_${compversion}   ## Set to appropriate tag if need be
    compurl=git@gitlab.science.gc.ca:MIG/${compname}.git
    git remote add ${compname} ${compurl}
    git fetch --tags ${compname}
    git subtree add -P ${compname} --squash ${compname} ${comptag} \
        -m "subtree_pull: tag=${comptag}; url=${compurl}; dir=${compname}"
    for tag in $(git ls-remote --tags ${compname} | awk '{print $2}' | tr '\n' ' ') ; do
       git tag -d ${tag##*/}
    done
    git remote rm ${compname}

    echo "${compname}=${compurl}/${comptag}" >> DEPENDENCIES

Make sure the component has the needed required directories, files and content
for MIG integration/build system.  
See the [layout section](#layout) above.

> You'll need to re-do the [Initial Setup](README_building.md#initial-setup)

### Update a Component ###

> Before this step, it is best to commit any other changes you may have.

> *This would normally be done by the librarian* when changes were push to
> the components repository instead of the MIG's.  
>
> Committing and pushing updates to MIG then pushing to individual
> components is preferred (reversed way).  
> See [Contribute Back, Share](#contribute-back-share) for details.

To update an existing component, use `git subtree pull` to import its
repository's updates in MIG and then update its reference in MIG's
DEPENDENCY list:

    compname=MYNAME                      ## Set to appropriate name
    compversion=MYVERSION                ## Set to appropriate version
    comptag=${compname}_${compversion}   ## Set to appropriate tag if need be
    compurl=git@gitlab.science.gc.ca:MIG/${compname}.git
    git remote add ${compname} ${compurl}
    git fetch --tags ${compname}
    git subtree pull -P ${compname} --squash ${compname} ${comptag} \
        -m "subtree_pull: tag=${comptag}; url=${compurl}; dir=${compname}"
    for tag in $(git ls-remote --tags ${compname} | awk '{print $2}' | tr '\n' ' ') ; do
       git tag -d ${tag##*/}
    done
    git remote rm ${compname}

    _bin/migdepupdater.ksh -v --gitdep --check


### Getting Others' Modifications ###

To include other developers' MIG clone modifications, you may merge from
their repository or apply patches they have provided you.

> Patching and Merging can be complex, and should not be taken lightly.

> Before this step, it is best to commit any other changes you may have.


#### Merging: Applying Patches ####

> Patches are expected to have been created with  
> `BASETAG=      ## Need to define from what tag (or hash) to produce patches`  
> `git format-patch ${BASETAG}..HEAD`

If your patch is to be applied on a sub component (sub directory),
then set MYDIR to its name (example for gemdyn below).

    MYDIR="--directory=gemdyn"

Define the PATH/NAME of the patch file:

    MYPATH=/PATH/TO/${MYPATCH}

Before applying the patch, you may check it with:

    git apply --stat ${MYPATCH}
    git apply --check ${MYDIR} ${MYPATCH}

Fully apply the patch

    git am --signoff ${MYDIR} ${MYPATCH}

Selective application (if fully apply does not work or you want to exclude
some parts), random list of commands

    git apply --reject PATH/TO/INCLUDE   ${MYDIR} ${MYPATCH}
    git apply --reject --include PATH/TO/INCLUDE  ${MYDIR}  ${MYPATCH}
    git am    --include PATH/TO/INCLUDE  ${MYDIR} ${MYPATCH}
    git apply --exclude PATH/TO/EXCLUDE  ${MYDIR} ${MYPATCH}
    git am    --exclude PATH/TO/EXCLUDE  ${MYDIR} ${MYPATCH}


Fixing apply/am problems

  * inspect the rejection
  * apply the patch manually (with an editor)
  * add file modified by the patch (git add...)
  * git am --continue

> Note: it is best, to avoid potential conflicts, to apply the patch directly
> on top of the `${BASETAG}` they were produced from. If you have
> modifications of your own on top of `${BASETAG}` you may want to
> * create a branch from `${BASETAG}`:  
>   `git checkout -b ${BASETAG}-mine ${BASETAG}`
> * apply the patch on that branch as above
> * merge it to your branch:  
>   `git checkout MYBRANCH && git merge ${BASETAG}-mine && git branch -d ${BASETAG}-mine`

>   * https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25846189/git-am-error-patch-does-not-apply
>   * https://www.drupal.org/node/1129120


#### Merging: Pulling Others' Code ####

1. Add a remote branch for the other's repository
````
git remote add NAME URL/PATH
````
2. Fetch the remote repository and check-it-out at the provided tag as a local branch
````
git fetch NAME
git checkout -b NAMELOCAL TAGNAME
````
3. Merge that local branch in your own branch
````
BRANCH=          ## Set the branch name you are working on
git checkout ${BRANCH}
git merge NAMELOCAL
````
4. Fix/Merge the patch if needed

5. Remove remote
````
git remote rm NAME
````

### Revert Changes ###

Whenever you made a change you no longer want, it is easy with `git` to return
to a previous iteration.

To reset/revert all files:  
*This does erase the history, local changes and commits may be lost, proceed with care*

    git reset --hard HASH

To reset/revert only specific file(s):  
*This does not erase the history, only local, not yet committed, changes may be lost*

    git checkout HASH -- PATH/TO/FILE

> `HASH` can be:
> * a TAG (`git tag -l`), 
> * an actual commit hash (`git log --pretty=oneline`),
> * `HEAD`, a special keyword referring to the last commit

> Note: do not perform a revert (`git reset --hard HASH`) beyond your
> local commits, or any code already shared with others, since this would
> make sharing your modifications difficult.


### Branches, Parallel Development ###

Git allow you to work on several branches (kind of virtual directories) in
parallel. This may be useful to test something before integrating (merging)
it into your main development branch.

Creating a new branch is as simple as:

    git checkout -b NEWBRANCH HASH     ## creates a new branch from the HASH

> `HASH` can be:
> * a BRANCH (`git branch`),
> * a TAG (`git tag -l`),
> * an actual commit hash (`git log --pretty=oneline`),
> * `HEAD`, a special keyword referring to the last commit (this is the default)

You can go back and forth between the NEWBRANCH and your MAINBRANCH with a
simple `git checkout BRANCHNAME`.
*Make sure you changes are committed before switching branches.`

When you are satisfied with this branch's code, and it is fully committed,
you may merge it back into your main development branch:

    git checkout MAINBRANCH
    git merge NEWBRANCH

For house keeping, it is best to remove old branches that have been fully merge
or that are no longer needed (code you no longer want to keep).

    git branch -D NEWBRANCH


### Cleaning up ###

To remove all files created by the setup, compile and build process,
use the `distclean` target.

        make distclean

You may further clean up the GEM dir by removing all imported components with
the following command.
> **WARNING**: To avoid loosing your modifications. make sure you created
> patches (saved elsewhere) or `git push` the modified components' code
> before removing all imported components.


Contribute Back, Share
----------------------

When sharing your modifications to the librarian or other developers, users,
there are 3 ways you can go about it.


### Send Pull Request ###

The best way to give your code back to be included, merged, into the upcoming
MIG/GEM version is to send a pull request to the librarian.

* First tag the version of the code (the specific commit) you tested successfully:  
  `git tag TAGNAME`
* Then send the URL or PATH to you repository, along with the TAGNAME

> Make sure you do not delete the repository and references before others
> were able to *fetch* it.


### Create Patches ###

Otherwise you may create patches to be shared.

    BASETAG=      ## Need to define from what tag (or hash) to produce patches
    git format-patch ${BASETAG}..HEAD

    expname=SOME_EXPLICIT_NAME   ## Provide an explicit name
    patchname="${BASETAG}_${expname}.patch.tgz"
    rm -f ${patchname}
    tar czf ${patchname} $(ls *.patch)

Then send the PATH to your patches (`${patchname}`).


### Push Upstream ###

If your have *write permissions* in the original MIG Git repositories,
you can `git push` your modifications directly.

> The librarian will have to do this after merging in, or applying patch of,
> others' contributions.

> Note: Pushing modifications upstream is not an "easily" reversible operation.  
> You may want to double check your commits and proceed with care.

Push the MIG super-repos

    migbranch="$(git symbolic-ref --short HEAD)"
    git push origin ${migbranch} && git push --tags origin

If you have *write permissions* in the original components' Git repositories,
you may tag and push individual components.

**Pushing all components**

This is a 3 steps process:

    ## Check that branches and tags are as expected before doing the actual push below
    _bin/migsplitsubtree.ksh --dryrun

    ## Tag components and push
    _bin/migsplitsubtree.ksh --tag --push

    ## Cleanup repository garbage following remote import (fetch)
    _bin/migsplitsubtree.ksh --clean


**Pushing only one component**

To update an existing component, use `git subtree push` to export its
repository's updates in MIG:

    compname=MYNAME                      ## Set to appropriate name
    compversion=MYVERSION                ## Set to appropriate version
    compbranch=${compname}_${compversion}-branch   ## Set to appropriate branch if need be
    compurl=git@gitlab.science.gc.ca:MIG/${compname}.git
    git remote add ${compname} ${compurl}
    git subtree push -P ${compname} ${compname} ${compbranch}
    git remote rm ${compname}

> Note: contrary to the `_bin/migsplitsubtree.ksh` script above, this will not do any 
> checking and will not add the component's tag.

* Reseting all changes after committing

      git reset --hard HEAD^

* Reseting change of only one file before committing

      git checkout HEAD -- /PATH/TO/FILE

* Reseting change of only one file after committing

      git checkout HEAD^ -- /PATH/TO/FILE

* Reseting present work (not committed) and save it for later

      git stash
      # git stash pop  #to retrieve it later

* Start a topic branch

      git checkout -b branch_name
