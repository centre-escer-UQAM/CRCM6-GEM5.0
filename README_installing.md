Installing MIG/GEM from Version Control
=======================================

This document is intended as a notebook and checklist for the Model
Infrastructure Group (MIG) librarian.
It is only valid on EC/CMC and GC/Science Networks.

> **This README assumes**:  
>
> The MIG repository is already cloned and the desired version is
> already checked out.  
> *See [Getting the code](README.md#getting-the-code) section for more details.*  
>
> The modifications are already committed and tested.  
> *See [README\_developing.md](README_developing.md) and
> [README\_running.md](README_running.md) for more details.*
>
> The code is already compiled and built.  
> *See [README\_building.md](README_building.md) for more details.*

Updating the MIG Repository Content
===================================

1.1 - Update Code, Scripts and more
-----------------------------------

  * **Merge in code from other devs** (and from other branches if any).  
    You may use
    * "`git merge`", "`git rebase`" for other's repos.  
      (see "*Merging: Pulling Others' Code*" section in
      [README\_developing.md](README_developing.md#merging-pulling-others-code)
    * "`git apply`", "`git am`" for patches  
      Special care needs to be taken for patches provided on top of a
      component's repository (not MIG).  
      (see "*Merging: Applying Patches*" section in
      [README\_developing.md](README_developing.md#merging-applying-patches)

  * **Check for code conformance**  
    **TODO** - need to set a list of things to check and maybe a "linter" script to report/fix issues (!$omp indentation, #include <arch_specific.hf>, Fortran 2004 std, ...).

  * **Test**  
    Before accepting new code from others or including your own modifications
    you may want to make sure it passes all tests.  
    See [testing section](#testing) below.


1.2 - Update Compiler Options
-----------------------------

The compiler is specified as an external dependency in the
"`_migdep/DEPENDENCIES.external.*.bndl`" files.  
Compiler options, rules and targets are specified in each component's Makefiles (`*/include/Makefile.local*mk` files).  
For details, see:
  * [Dependencies Update](README_developing.md#dependencies-update)
  * [Compiler Options Update](README_developing.md#compiler-options-update)


1.3 - Update Versions and Dependencies
--------------------------------------

#### Versions ####

Every component has a "`VERSION`" file and there is an additional one
for MIG on the top level dir.
You need to update these version numbers for each components with modifications.

    emacs VERSION */VERSION


#### Dependencies ####

Updating these files is automated with the following script
(once the VERSION numbers have been updated)

    _bin/migdepupdater.ksh -v --gitdep --migver --check


*Note*: external dependencies *need to be maintained manually*. Most common
        external dependencies are specified in the
        "`_migdep/DEPENDENCIES.external.*.bndl`" files. Make sure they are
        consistent with other components, especially for duplicate items.

    emacs */DEPENDENCIES.external.*.bndl

For details, see:

  * [Dependencies Update](README_developing.md#dependencies-update)


1.4 - Tag and Push Modifications
--------------------------------

Pre-push check list

  * make sure you completed the above steps
    * [1.1 - Update Code, Scripts and more](#11---update-code-scripts-and-more)
    * [1.2 - Update Compiler Options](#12---update-compiler-options)
    * [1.3 - Update Versions and Dependencies](#13---update-versions-and-dependencies)

  * make sure everything if fully committed

        git status

  * make sure the code compile, build and passes tests *before* pushing it.  
    See [testing section](#testing) below.

Tag this MIG version

    migversion="$(cat VERSION)"
    git tag mig_${migversion##*/}


Push the MIG super-repos as described in the
[push upstream section](README_developing.md#push-upstream)

    ## Push to MIG's super-repos
    migbranch="$(git symbolic-ref --short HEAD)"
    git push origin ${migbranch} && git push --tags origin

    ## Check that branches and tags are as expected before doing the actual push below
    _bin/migsplitsubtree.ksh --dryrun

    ## Tag components and push
    _bin/migsplitsubtree.ksh --tag --push

    ## Cleanup repository garbage following remote import (fetch)
    _bin/migsplitsubtree.ksh --clean


1.5 - Close Issues

Testing
=======

This section assumes you already
[updated the MIG repository content](#updating-the-mig-repository-content) and
[compiled, built](README_building.md) the changes you want to install.

Testing must be performed in the same directory and same SHELL you used to compile and build MIG's component.

Testing should have been minimally done by developers before the code was
sent and merged in.  
See [README\_running.md](README_running.md) for more details.

Librarian should perform additional tests:

  * pre-installation canonical tests: **TODO**: (set of canonical cases, MPI/OMP conformance, ...
  * post-installation tests: **TODO**: (RI run interactive and batch, compile/build test, ...)


Installing MIG/GEM from Version Control
=======================================

This section assumes you already
[updated the MIG repository content](#updating-the-mig-repository-content),
[compiled, built](README_building.md) and [tested](#testing) the version
you want to install.

Testing and installation must be performed in the same directory and same SHELL you used to compile and build MIG's component.

> Make sure compilation and building is done on *all* arch/platform you want
> the installation to be done.

The following dir. are expected to exists for installation purpose only
(optional if you only wish to compile, build and run w/o installation).
Note that large files will be written to these dir.

    ~/SsmDepot/
    ~/SsmBundle/

> *Note*: Installation is performed by the following users:
> * `armnenv` on the EC/CMC network
> * `sgem000` on the GC/Science network


Install
-------

Installation can only be performed by the librarian who has proper permissions.
This would be done on the EC/CMC and GC/Science networks.  
You may specify the list of `COMPONENTS` to install, default installs all components.

> **Note**: Installation of a component will be skipped if an installation
> is already done.  
> To replace an existing installation first perform an `uninstall` of
> the changed components as described below. Make sure you do not uninstall
> something used by other users.

**To Do on All Arch**

    # COMPONENTS=""
    # export SSM_TEST_INSTALL=1  ## Note: Set this to install under /tests/
    make ssmarch SSM_TEST_INSTALL=${SSM_TEST_INSTALL:-0} \
         # COMPONENTS="${COMPONENTS}"

**To Do only on the Front End Machine**

    ## Note: `make ssmarch` on all arch must be done before
    # COMPONENTS=""
    # export SSM_TEST_INSTALL=1  ## Note: Set this to install under /tests/
    make ssmall SSM_TEST_INSTALL=${SSM_TEST_INSTALL:-0} \
         # COMPONENTS="${COMPONENTS}"

    if [[ ${RDENETWORK:-cmc} == "science" ]] ; then
        SSM_BASE=/fs/ssm/eccc/mrd/rpn/MIG
    fi
    make components_install CONFIRM_INSTALL=yes \
         SSM_SKIP_INSTALLED=--skip-installed \
         SSM_TEST_INSTALL=${SSM_TEST_INSTALL:-0} \
         SSM_BASE=${SSM_BASE:-~/SsmBundles} \
         # COMPONENTS="${COMPONENTS}"


#### Post Install ####

**To Do only on the Front End Machine**

    ## Final operation once all tests are ok
    VERSION="$(cat gem/VERSION)"
    if [[ ${SSM_TEST_INSTALL:-0} == 1 ]] ; then
       cd ~/SsmBundles/GEM/test/
       ln -s gem/${VERSION##*/}.bndl .
    else
       cd ~/SsmBundles/GEM/${VERSION%/*}
       ln -s gem/${VERSION##*/}.bndl .
     fi

**To Do on All Arch**

Make sure the installed version compile, build and passes tests.  
See [testing section](#testing) below.

Uninstall
---------

Uninstallation can only be performed by the librarian who has proper permissions.
This would be done on the EC/CMC and GC/Science networks.
You may specify the list of `COMPONENTS` to uninstall, default uninstalls all components.

> **WARNING**: Uninstall cannot be reverted, make sure you do not
> uninstall something used by other users.

**To Do only on the Front End Machine**

    # COMPONENTS=""
    # export SSM_TEST_INSTALL=1  ## Note: Set this to install under /tests/
    make components_uninstall UNINSTALL_CONFIRM=yes \
        SSM_TEST_INSTALL=${SSM_TEST_INSTALL:-0} \
        # SSM_BASE=/fs/ssm/eccc/mrd/rpn/MIG \
        # COMPONENTS="${COMPONENTS}"


Cleaning up
-----------

To remove all files created by the setup, compile and build process, use the `distclean` target.

    make distclean
    rm -f */ssmusedep*bndl gem/ATM_MODEL_*
